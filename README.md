# Molecular Dynamics Program

A simple implementation of a Molecular Dynamics simulation making use of the velocity Verlet algorithm. The program was written in the context of the *Molecular Dynamics of Time-Dependent Phenomena* course taught in the winter term 2021/2022.

The program was developed using the [Fortran Package Manager (fpm)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm).  
Run with `fpm run`.
